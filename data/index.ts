    category: "Project for MIT iQuHACK 2025",
    content: "If your job's to figure out the two secret prime-number ingredients that were multiplied together to create one massive cake. A classical computer would have to taste and guess the ingredients one by one in a long-painstaking process. Shor's algorithm uses a QC as a parallel food processor. It places all the possible ingredients in a state of quantum superposition; like having the flavor of every possible ingredient at once. Our team worked on the implementation of Shor's Algorithm for factoring semiprime numbers using the Quantum Rings Simulator. Our goal is to leverage quantum computation to factor numbers of increasing bit sizes while demonstrating the universality of Shor’s algorithm."

I love to see the knots untangling in their brain and the Light bulb moment that slowly lits up on their faces. So, I am making videos explaining topics. Although I love/need constant feedbacks; kinda like a trial & error thingy (my explaination runs on feedbacks). But you can still give these Vidsplainers a try.'
